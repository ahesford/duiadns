This is a simple dynamic updater for DUIA DNS written in Python.

Dependencies:

  - netaddr 0.7.18
    * https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netaddr/

  - netifaces 2015-07-01, https://bitbucket.org/steffann/netifaces/ 
    * This is a fork of netifaces (https://bitbucket.org/al45tair/netifaces)
      that indicates temporary or deprecated IPv6 addresses
    * Commit: ac082cd

  - requests 2.7.0, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests/

The updater can optionally update IPv4 or IPv6 addresses for one or more
hostnames using the same MD5 password hash. Parameters are encoded in a simple
INI-style configuration. A commented sample is provided. To invoke the updater,
simply run

	duiadns.py /path/to/config

This script can be run by a regular user, but running as root (especially
periodically) is recommended to allow permissions on the configuration file to
be restricted to prevent disclosure of the MD5 password hash.

IPv4 addresses are determined from the response of http://ipv4.duiadns.net/.

IPv6 addresses are determined from the response of http://ipv6.duiadns.net/.
However, because IPv6 allows for temporary addresses (OS X does this by
default), the updater substitutes the first non-temporary and non-link-local
address on the interface advertising the web-discovered address whenever the
web-discovered address is itself temporary.

The HTTP interface is used instead of HTTPS because the SSL certificate for
duiadns.net is not signed by an authority recognized by default on OS X, so
HTTPS updates will fail without prior user action.
